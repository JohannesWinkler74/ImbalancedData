    "## Experiment concerning the Simpson's Paradox in hyppthetical university admission data\n",
    "#### The following jupyter notebook accompanies the seminar paper \"Methods to correct an imbalanced dataset\" by Johannes Winkler. It generates an imbalanced dataset of hypothetical students applying to a university that exhibits the so-called Simpson's Paradox. Different resmampling methods are applied to the data and the admission probabilities for female and male students are calculated again. The comparison of the (conditional) admission probabilites before and after applying the resampling methods sheds some light on wether these increase the Simpson's Paradox."
